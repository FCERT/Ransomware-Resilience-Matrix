# Ransomware-Resilience-Matrix

This file contains the Template for the FCERT Ransomware Resilience Matrix based on an exercise developed by FCERT during the first half year of 2020.
It is based on several ransomware types and highlights overlapping techniques used by those sample ransomware attack vectors.
This template can be used for mapping controls which help protect against the identified techniques.

FCERT has mapped several recommendations in the format of critical questions in the crosssections of control vs technique. A few samples are provided.
Purpose of the Matrix is to keep a continuous overview on the full kill chain and enable an organisation to fill in the mapping according to their own set-up.
This is intended to help gain insight into where gaps or priorities for mitigations should be focused on.

Since the ransomware attack vectors keep evolving, organisations using the matrix should also keep updating the identified techniques relevant for their organisation and organise the use of the worksheet efficiently. For example by having different teams updating one central version.

Let us know any feedback or suggestions for improvement, or ideas for integrations with tooling at info AT fcert.nl. Thanks.
